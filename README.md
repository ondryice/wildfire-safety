# Etiquette
Developers should follow etiquette when making changes to the website, and the following details the best practices for doing so.

## Epics & Issues
We use agile development for this website, and developers should only work within this paradigm.
Epics are the groups of tasks that we work through to develop the site.
Issues are the "subtasks" associated with the Epics.
The *team* works on epics, while team *members* work on Issues.
If the work needed to complete an issue *can* be done by more than one person, it should be split up into multiple tasks.

### Epics
Every Epic currently being worked on must belong to the current milestone.
In general, Epics should not be assigned to a milestone unless they are currently being worked on.

### Issues
Every Issue *must* belong to an Epic, and should have an estimate.
In general, the estimate should *roughly* correspond to the number of hours expected to complete the Issue.
An estimate of `1` indicates a very simple, and quick, task.
An estimate of `2` indicates a simple task, but it may take longer to complete.
An estimate of `3` or `4` indicates a complicated task that may take a long time to complete.

# Development
This website is developed with ReactJS, a "flavor" of javascript.
The workflow is a flavor of agile development, through the use of ZenHub, a popular extension for GitHub.

## Resources for Development
