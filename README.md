The workflow is a flavor of agile development, through the use of ZenHub, a popular extension for GitHub.

## Resources for Development

### GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)
See the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for GFM.
We use GFM for all our Markdown (extension `.md`) files.
