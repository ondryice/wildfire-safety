## Product Goal
#### The end goal of the product is an easy-to-use, mobile-friendly website for quickly finding information on disaster-preparedness as a community.

## Sprint Goals
#### This sprint goal is to have a complete and optimal workspace environment within GitHub and ZenHub, with well-established procedures for development and organization.

## Scrum Master
#### *Andréas Johnson*

## Definition of Done
- [ ] ZenHub is configured with **issue** templates and task labels
- [ ] Team members are all made collaborators on GitHub, and can each make and merge pull requests
- [ ] A functioning version of the website is deployed for production
- [ ] The design document is up-to-date and well-captures the overall site look-and-feel

## Policies
- GitHub etiquette regarding branches, commits, and pull requests
- ZenHub etiquette regarding the naming of issues, assigning epics to issues, point-estimates, and labeling
- Scrum notes & metrics are captured, below

## Planned Epics
We plan to complete all of the epics listed, below.
These epics will set the backbone of the project, and define the component hierarchy of the website.
As such, these epics are important to complete ASAP.

#### [Initial Setup](https://github.com/ondryice/wildfire-safety/issues/1)
This epic involves the invitations of team members, README documentation, creation of reports, etc.
The tasks associated with this epic are strictly organizational.

#### [Navbar](https://github.com/ondryice/wildfire-safety/issues/6)
This epic is the creation of the `Navbar` component, which users will use to navigate to the website's subpages.
The component should be easily scalable, allowing for future updates and expansion.
Further, the `Navbar` should be responsive and unobtrusive.

#### [HomePage](https://github.com/ondryice/wildfire-safety/issues/11)
This epic is the creation of the `HomePage` component, which will be the default website content for users.
The `HomePage` should have a hero section containing some easy "go-to" information on wildfire-preparedness.
The `HomePage` should also be easily expanded or modified, using page sections that can be added without modifying the `render()` method, rather simply updating a class variable `this.sections`.
